Create funciton initializes game physics and then calls initialization functions for the ship, the enemy, and the rocks

Game's update function calls update functions of ship, enemy, and rocks

Took any code updating ship prototype and put it in its own file. Same with the enemy.

Created separate rocks.js file containing initializeRock, updateRock, and killRock

Called overlap collision functions based on the collectStar() function from the phaser tutorial.

This is the best I could do working with the "prototype" deal which I am still unfamiliar with.

I really hope I understand this lab one day.
