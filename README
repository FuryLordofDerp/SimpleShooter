Took any code updating ship and put it in its own updatePlayer function in the actual player file. Same with the enemy

Created separate rocks.js file containing initializeRock and updateRock

Called overlap-based collision functions based on the collectStar() function from the phaser tutorial

These collision functions are called in the overlap functions that should work with either sprites or groups, but don't seem to work with the kill() function even though I can find no indistinguishable difference with what I'm doing and what was in the phaser tutorial

This is the best I could do.
